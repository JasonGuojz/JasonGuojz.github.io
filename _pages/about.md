Welcome to my homepage! 
I am a Senior student at [Department of Information Science & Electronic Engineering](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), China.
Previously, I collaborated with [Prof. Chunguang Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cgli) and proposed an hash learning algorithm based on deep neural network for large scale CBIR problems.  
## Research Interests
Currently I'm focusing on knowledge extraction and weak supervision relayed topics.
